# sobole

Minimalistic `zsh` theme inspired by the old-fashioned hobbies.


## Showcase


## Installation

Just copy the [`sobole.zsh-theme`](/sobole.zsh-theme) to your `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/` folder.

This set of commands will probably do what you want:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sobolevn/sobole-zsh-theme.git
ln -s $PWD/sobole-zsh-theme/sobole.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/sobole.zsh-theme
```

Here's the [official docs](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-and-adding-themes) on how to do that.
